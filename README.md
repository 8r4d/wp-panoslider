Just playing around with a simple plugin to add a Gutenberg block feature for WordPress. 

I personally take a lot of panoramic photos on my phone, you know the kind: big, ultrawide images in "pano" mode. When I upload them to my blog they are either cropped or shrunk so small that they are not especially impressive to display.

My solution was a simple horizontally scrolling image. The block displays a properly proportioned image as set by the fixed image height in the editor, except the overflow disappears into the magical void that is the margin of your content width.  Using the buttons, scrollbar or a finger on mobile, the user can scroll the image back and forth, left to right, allowing a simple but effective sharing of images in a more enjoyable resolution.
